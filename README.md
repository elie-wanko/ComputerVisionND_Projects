# Udacity - Computer Vision Nanodegree Projects

As part of the Computer Vision nanodegree from UDacity I learned cutting-edge computer vision and deep learning techniquesâ€”from basic image processing, to building and customizing convolutional neural networks. Applying these concepts to vision tasks such as automatic image captioning and object tracking, and build a robust portfolio of computer vision projects.

## 1. Facial Keypoint Detection [(Code)](https://github.com/elie-wanko/ComputerVisionND-_-Projects/tree/master/P1_Facial_Keypoints)
Used image processing techniques and deep learning to recognize faces and facial keypoints, such as the location of the eyes and mouth on a face.

## 2. Automatic Image Captioning
Combine CNN and RNN knowledge to build a network that automatically produces captions, given an input image.

## 3. Landmark Detection & Tracking
Use sensor data to localize a robot and build a map of the environment with SLAM.
